# Can Apps Spy on You ?

The goal of this repo is to create a set of applications that can record audio from a users cell phone, send it to a backend to be parsed into keywords, and then do something such as send an ad back to the client based on what was recorded.

# TODO

App:

display in app what words were just parsed in toast or somthing
